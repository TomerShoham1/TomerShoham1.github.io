I am a Ph.D. Student for Computer Science, studying at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. I have a Bachelor's degree in Statistics and Economy, and a Master's degree in Statistics. My Master's Thesis, Asking the Proper Question: Adjusting Queries to Statistical Procedures Under Differential Privacy focuses on differential privacy and statistical tests. 

Currently working in the field of adaptive data analysis, with implications to the "science of doing science", and hypotheses testing under the constraint of differential privacy. Adding noise to things is my guilty pleasure.

I'm also a Research Assistant of Prof. Gil Kalai at at the Reichman University, Herzliya, where I work on statistical aspects of experimenting with quantum computers, and mainly on the Google supremacy claim made in 2019.

My PhD advisors are Katrina Ligett and Yosef Rinott.
