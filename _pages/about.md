## Hey there!
I am a Ph.D. Student for Computer Science, studying at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. I have a Bachelor's degree in Statistics and Economy, and a Master's degree in Statistics. My Master's Thesis, Asking the Proper Question: Adjusting Queries to Statistical Procedures Under Differential Privacy focuses on differential privacy and statistical tests. I'm probably the only CS student who doesn't know how to code in Python, but I do know how to code in R, and I love it.

## P.h.D research
Currently working in the field of statistical testing and differential privacy, mainly non-parametric confidence intervals, private statistical testing, and sensitive statistics. Adding noise to things is my guilty pleasure.
My PhD advisors are Katrina Ligett (CS department) and Yosef Rinott (Statistics department).

## Other Research Interests
I'm also a Research Assistant of Prof. Gil Kalai at at the Reichman University, Herzliya, where I work on statistical aspects of experimenting with quantum computers, and mainly on the Google supremacy claim made in 2019. We have a line of papers- you are welcome to check them out on my publications page.

## Other than that,
