I am a Ph.D. Student for Computer Science, studying at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. I have a Bachelor's degree in Statistics and Economy, and a Master's degree in Statistics. My Master's Thesis, Asking the Proper Question: Adjusting Queries to Statistical Procedures Under Differential Privacy focuses on differential privacy and statistical tests. 

Currently working in the field of adaptive data analysis, with implications to the "science of doing science", and hypotheses testing under the constraint of differential privacy. Adding noise to things is my guilty pleasure.

I'm also a Research Assistant of Prof. Gil Kalai at at the Reichman University, Herzliya, where I work on statistical aspects of experimenting with quantum computers, and mainly on the Google supremacy claim made in 2019.

My PhD advisors are Katrina Ligett and Yosef Rinott.

Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.
