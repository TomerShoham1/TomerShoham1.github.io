excerpt: 'In October 2019, "Nature" published a paper describing an experimental work that took place at Google. The paper claims to demonstrate quantum (computational) supremacy on a 53-qubit quantum computer. Since September 2019 the authors have been involved in a long-term project to study various statistical aspects of the Google experiment. In particular, we have been trying to gather the relevant data and information, to reconstruct and verify those parts of the Google 2019 supremacy experiments that are based on classical computations (unless they require too heavy computation), and to put the data under statistical analysis. This document describes the available data and information for the Google 2019 experiment and some of our results and plans.'
