I am a Ph.D. Student for Computer Science, studying at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. I have a Bachelor's degree in Statistics and Economy, and a Master's degree in Statistics. My Master's Thesis, Asking the Proper Question: Adjusting Queries to Statistical Procedures Under Differential Privacy focuses on differential privacy and statistical tests. 

Currently working in the field of statistical testing and differential privacy, mainly non-parametric confidence intervals. Adding noise to things is my guilty pleasure.

I'm also a Research Assistant of Prof. Gil Kalai at at the Reichman University, Herzliya, where I work on statistical aspects of experimenting with quantum computers, and mainly on the Google supremacy claim made in 2019. We have a line of papers- you are welcome to check them out on my publications page.

My PhD advisors are Katrina Ligett (CS department) and Yosef Rinott (Statistics department).
