permalink: /publication/Differentially_private_ratio_statistics
excerpt: 'This paper give results that can guide practice in evaluating ratios when the results must be protected by differential privacy. In particular, we show that even a simple algorithm can provide excellent properties concerning privacy, sample accuracy, and bias, not just asymptotically but also at quite small sample sizes. Additionally, we analyze a differentially private estimator for relative risk, prove its consistency, and develop a method for constructing valid confidence intervals'
